Peass-CI
===================

The Peass-CI-Plugin enables a continuous performance measurement for Java projects in an Jenkins server. By integrating Peass-CI in your build process, you will get performance measurements of each unit test and a measurement of call tree nodes, which pinpoints the root cause of your performance changes. Therefore, the following steps are executed:
- Regression Test Selection: The unit tests which may have changed performance based on the current commit will be selected by a combination of static and dynamic code analysis.
- Performance Measurement: The selected tests will be executed (repeating them inside a VM and starting the JVM, as often as you specify it) to identify performance changes.
- Root Cause Analysis: For every identified performance change, the measurement will be repeated with additional instrumentation of your call tree to identify the method call(s) which cause your performance change (optional).

Peass-CI is currently a research prototype and may not work fully. Please file issues if problems occur.

# Building

First get peass by running `git clone https://github.com/DaGeRe/peass.git && cd peass && mvn clean install -DskipTests`. Then, execute `mvn clean package`.

# Running

For installing Peass-CI to your Jenkins installation, you may either upload it through the website (Manage Jenkins -> Manage Plugins -> Advanced -> Upload Plugin) or stop Jenkins, copy `target/peass-ci.hpi` to `~/.jenkins/plugins` (or wherever your Jenkins home is) and restart Jenkins. Afterwards, when configuring your project, the `Measure Version Performance` step is available. Peass-CI is currently not available in the plugin repository.

If you want to include Peass-CI in your Jenkins Pipeline, you may configure it like this:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean package'
            }
        }
        stage('measurement') {
            steps {
                measure VMs: 30, iterations: 10, warmup: 10, repetitions: 100000
            }
        }
    }
}
```
See the [Wiki entry for measurement process configuration](https://github.com/DaGeRe/peass/wiki/Configuration-of-Measurement-Processes) for starting points for configuring the measurement step for your project.

For testing, run `mvn hpi:run` and access `localhost:8080/jenkins`. 

# Example

After successfull experiment execution, you'll get an overview over performance measurements (and especially the detected changes) like this:

For every change, you get a call tree:

And in the call tree, you can view the measurements for individual call tree nodes and the source change of these nodes:
